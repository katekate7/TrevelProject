# TrevelProject Security Guide

## Security Best Practices

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the TrevelProject and provides guidelines for maintaining and enhancing security.

## 1. Regular Security Audits

- Run the `security_check.sh` script monthly to check for basic security issues
- Schedule quarterly comprehensive security reviews
- Use automated vulnerability scanning tools
- Consider an annual penetration test for critical application components

## 2. Server Hardening

### Production Environment
- Use HTTPS only (redirect HTTP to HTTPS)
- Implement proper firewall rules
- Keep server software up-to-date
- Use minimal permissions for service accounts
- Configure secure SSL/TLS settings (disable outdated protocols and ciphers)
- Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

### Database Security
- Limit database access to application server IP only
- Use strong, unique passwords for database users
- Implement least-privilege principle for database users
- Regular database backups with encrypted storage

## 3. Development Practices

### Code Security
- Follow OWASP Top 10 recommendations
- Validate all inputs on both client and server sides
- Use parameterized queries for database interactions
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive details
- Review code for security vulnerabilities before deployment

### Dependency Management
- Regularly update dependencies
- Use tools like Symfony security:check and npm audit
- Subscribe to security bulletins for major libraries used

## 4. Authentication & Authorization

### Password Security
- Enforce strong password requirements
- Implement account lockout after failed login attempts
- Use secure password reset flows with limited-time tokens
- Consider adding multi-factor authentication for admin accounts

### Session Management
- Use secure, HttpOnly, SameSite cookies
- Implement proper session expiration
- Invalidate sessions on password change and suspicious activity

## 5. API Security

### API Protection
- Validate all inputs with strong validation rules
- Implement rate limiting on all endpoints
- Use proper HTTP methods and status codes
- Implement resource-based authorization

### JWT Management
- Use short-lived JWT tokens
- Implement token refresh mechanism
- Store JWT secrets securely
- Consider implementing token revocation for logout

## 6. Data Protection

### Sensitive Data
- Minimize collection of sensitive data
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Implement proper data retention policies
- Consider data anonymization for analytics

### Logging & Monitoring
- Log security events (login attempts, permission changes, etc.)
- Avoid logging sensitive data
- Implement log rotation and secure storage
- Monitor logs for suspicious activities

## 7. Third-Party Integration

### External Services
- Validate responses from external services
- Use API keys with limited permissions
- Implement timeouts for external requests
- Have fallback mechanisms for service failures

## 8. Incident Response Plan

### In Case of Security Breach
1. Contain the breach (isolate affected systems)
2. Assess the damage (what data was compromised)
3. Fix vulnerabilities
4. Notify affected users (if personal data was breached)
5. Document the incident and update security measures

## 9. Security Testing

### Regular Tests
- Implement automated security tests
- Test authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Perform input validation tests
- Test business logic for security flaws

## 10. Security Update Procedure

1. Monitor security advisories for dependencies
2. Evaluate the impact of security vulnerabilities
3. Apply patches promptly
4. Test patched systems before deployment
5. Deploy updates with minimal downtime

Remember that security is an ongoing process, not a one-time implementation. Stay informed about new security threats and continuously improve your security measures.
