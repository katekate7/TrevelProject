# CI/CD Fix: Missing LOCK_DSN Environment Variable

## Problem Description
The CI/CD GitHub Actions workflow was failing during the test phase with the following error:
```
Error: Environment variable not found: "LOCK_DSN".
```

This error occurred during the execution of the `doctrine:schema:create` command in the test environment.

## Root Cause
The `LOCK_DSN` environment variable is required by Symfony's Lock component, but it was not defined in the test environment. While the main `.env` file had this variable defined, it wasn't being properly propagated to the test environment during the GitHub Actions workflow execution.

## Solution
The following changes were made to fix the issue:

1. **Added the `LOCK_DSN` variable to `.env.test` file**:
   ```
   # Lock configuration
   LOCK_DSN=flock
   ```

2. **Updated the GitHub Actions workflow file to include `LOCK_DSN` in the test environment**:
   - Added `LOCK_DSN=flock` to `.env.test.local` creation step
   - Added explicit `LOCK_DSN=flock` environment variable to the `doctrine:schema:create` command

## Future Considerations
- Ensure all required environment variables are properly documented
- Consider using a more comprehensive environment variable checking mechanism in the CI/CD pipeline
- Update the `.env.dist` or sample environment files to include all required variables

## Additional Information
The `LOCK_DSN` variable is used by Symfony's Lock component to prevent concurrent operations. For test environments, using `flock` is appropriate as it uses the filesystem for locking, which is simple and works well in most test scenarios.

For production environments, consider using a more robust locking mechanism like Redis or a database if high availability is required.
